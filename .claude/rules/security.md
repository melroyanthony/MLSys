# Security Rules

## Never Do
- Hardcode secrets, API keys, passwords, or tokens
- Use `eval()` or equivalent dynamic code execution
- Disable SSL/TLS verification
- Use MD5 or SHA1 for security purposes
- Store passwords in plaintext
- Use `innerHTML` or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization
- Trust user input without validation
- Use `*` for CORS origins in production

## Always Do
- Use parameterized queries (never string concatenation for SQL)
- Validate and sanitize all user input at API boundaries
- Use HTTPS for all external API calls
- Set secure, httpOnly, sameSite flags on cookies
- Use bcrypt or argon2 for password hashing
- Apply rate limiting to authentication endpoints
- Log security events (auth failures, permission denials)
- Use CSP headers to prevent XSS
